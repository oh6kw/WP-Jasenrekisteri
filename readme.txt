Membership register and dues invoicing for Finnish associations: Finnish reference numbers, QR and bank barcodes, bank file import.

== Description ==

OH6KW Jäsenrekisteri ("membership register") is a complete membership register and membership-fee invoicing tool for Finnish associations (yhdistys / ry), built into the WordPress admin. The user interface is in Finnish, because the plugin implements Finnish banking standards.

**Members**

* Your own membership classes with their own fees (e.g. Member 25 €, Youth member 10 €, Honorary member 0 €). Members of a 0 € class are never invoiced but still receive newsletters.
* Search, sorting, bulk actions and a full invoice and payment history for every member.
* Custom fields defined in the settings, such as a clubhouse key number (text) or a yes/no checkbox, optionally shown as a column in the member list.
* CSV import and export (Excel compatible). Columns are recognised from the headers.
* The resignation date is recorded, for accurate yearly member counts.
* Optional milestones: members reaching round birthdays (from an optional birth year or birth date) or membership anniversaries; the years are configurable and the feature can be switched off.

**Invoicing**

* One click sends every member an individual invoice by email, with a unique Finnish reference number (viitenumero, 7-3-1 check digit).
* Email invoices show a clear payment card that works on phones and computers: amount and due date, copyable payment details, a virtual barcode and an optional EPC QR code. The same A4 invoice as on paper can be attached as a PDF.
* Members who prefer paper, or have no email address, get a printable A4 invoice that fits a window envelope (C5/DL), with a traditional Finnish bank transfer form (tilisiirtolomake) and bank barcode at the bottom of the page, or a simpler standard layout. An optional postage fee can be added to paper invoices only.
* If a member loses an email invoice, the same A4 invoice can be printed or saved as PDF from the invoice page.
* Sending runs in small batches with a progress bar, so large member lists do not time out. Test invoices and previews before sending.
* Manual or automatic payment reminders.
* Members who join mid-season can be added to an invoice that has already been sent, with their own due date.

**Payments**

* Import payments from the bank: Finnish reference payment file (KTL), ISO 20022 camt.054 / camt.053 XML, or a bank statement CSV. Payments are matched by reference number, including RF references.
* A preview shows matching payments, differing amounts and unknown references before anything is saved. The same payment is never recorded twice.
* Excel export of all invoices: a summary, all open payments and one sheet per invoice.

**Reports for the general meeting and the accountant**

* Annual report for the general meeting: member counts per class at the start and end of the year, joined and resigned members, invoiced, paid and open fees, and fees received during the year. Printable and exportable to Excel.
* Membership fees for bookkeeping: a ready posting proposal for the accountant (debit bank account / credit membership fee income) per payment day or per month for any period, a breakdown by membership class, postage fees separately, payments that differ from the invoice, and open fees at the end of the period. Printable and exportable to Excel with every payment by member. The plugin does not do the bookkeeping itself – it gives the accountant what is needed, whatever bookkeeping software they use.
* Voting register for the general meeting: printable list of members entitled to vote (fee paid or fee-exempt class) with a signature column.
* Audit log: who changed what and when, including old and new values of member data, payments, sending, settings and exports. The retention period is configurable.

**Privacy, backup and moving**

* Privacy (GDPR): a pre-filled privacy notice template for the member register, and support for the WordPress personal data export and erase tools (members are found by email address; erasing anonymises the member and keeps the fee amounts for bookkeeping).
* Full backup in one file (JSON, compressed): members, invoices, payments, settings and optionally the audit log. Restore it on the same or another site, for example when the register moves to a new website. A summary is shown before restoring, the file is checked before anything is changed, and the previous state is kept so a restore can be undone.

**Newsletters**

* Email to all members, one membership class, or members with unpaid invoices. Placeholders such as {etunimi} (first name) personalise every message.

**Admin only – nothing is published on the website**

The plugin adds nothing to the public site: no pages, forms, shortcodes or blocks, and member data is never shown to visitors. The register lives in the WordPress admin and only administrators can use it.

WordPress does the heavy lifting: user login and roles (add two-factor authentication with a separate plugin if you like), automatic plugin updates, and your host's backups and HTTPS. The association gets a member register without a separate service, monthly fees or new accounts – it runs behind the website you already have.

Developed by Jarno Jaskari (oh6kw) together with Claude, an AI assistant made by Anthropic.

The plugin does not use any external services. All data stays in your own WordPress database. QR codes, barcodes, PDF and Excel files are generated locally without extra PHP extensions. Bundled libraries: qrcode-generator by Kazuhiko Arase (MIT) and FPDF by Olivier Plathey (permissive FPDF license), both GPL-compatible.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from Plugins → Add New, or upload the zip file, and activate it.
2. Open Jäsenrekisteri → Asetukset (Settings) and enter the association name, bank account (IBAN) and sender email address.
3. Add membership classes and their fees in the settings.
4. Add members manually or import them from a CSV file (Jäsenet → Tuo CSV).
5. Install an SMTP plugin (for example WP Mail SMTP or FluentSMTP) so that invoices are sent through the association's real email account and do not end up in spam.
6. Create an invoice (Laskutus → Uusi lasku), send a test invoice to yourself and then send the invoices.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin show anything on the website? =

No. It works only in the WordPress admin. It adds no pages, forms, shortcodes or blocks, and visitors never see member data.

= Does it do the association's bookkeeping? =

No. The plugin keeps the member register and membership fees. For the accountant it produces the "Membership fees for bookkeeping" report: a posting proposal, a breakdown and open fees, printable and in Excel. The bookkeeping and the financial statements are done in the association's own bookkeeping software or by its accountant.

= Does it work outside Finland? =

The plugin is designed for Finnish associations: it uses Finnish reference numbers, the Finnish bank barcode and Finnish bank file formats, and the user interface is in Finnish. The EPC QR code works with SEPA banks in general.

= Who can use the plugin? =

Only administrators (users with the manage_options capability). Members never see the register.

= Is the member data sent anywhere? =

No. All data stays in your WordPress database. Emails are sent through your site's own email settings. The only outgoing message the plugin can send to the developer is the optional feedback form on the "Tietoja ja palaute" page, and only when you fill it in and press send yourself.

= What happens to the data if I delete the plugin? =

When you deactivate the plugin you are asked whether the data should be kept or removed when the plugin is deleted. By default all data is kept. The choice can also be changed in the settings.

= Which bank files are supported? =

The Finnish reference payment file (KTL / viitesiirtoaineisto), ISO 20022 camt.054 and camt.053 XML files, and bank statement CSV files with reference and amount columns.

== Changelog ==

= 4.8.3 =
* Fix: CSV import no longer merges two different people who share an email address (e.g. a parent and a youth member). An email address alone now identifies an existing member only if the first name matches too.
* Fix: CSV import no longer merges people with the same name but a different member ID (e.g. call sign or member number).

= 4.8.2 =
* New: "Membership fees for bookkeeping" report (Annual report → second tab) for the treasurer and the accountant: a posting proposal (debit bank account / credit membership fee income) per payment day or per month for any period, breakdown by membership class, postage fees separately, payments that differ from the invoice, and open membership fees at the end of the period. Printable and exportable to Excel (including every payment by member). Account names or numbers are set in the settings. The plugin does not do bookkeeping itself.

= 4.8.1 =
* Email invoice: the bank transfer form layout is replaced by a payment card that works on phones and computers (amount and due date, copyable payment details, virtual barcode, QR code). Sites that used the old layout switch automatically.

= 4.7.2 =
* New: separate official association address (Settings → association details), used for the payee on the bank transfer form and in the privacy notice. The envelope return address stays a separate setting.
* Paper invoice: the bank transfer form no longer extends past its area at the bottom of the page; long payee and payer addresses no longer stretch the form.
* Paper invoice: the return address is shown on up to two lines and shrinks to fit; a warning is shown if an address does not fit the envelope window.

= 4.7.1 =
* Email invoice with the bank transfer form now includes the bank barcode (and QR code) according to the payment code setting, and is wider.

= 4.7.0 =

* New: privacy notice template and support for the WordPress personal data export and erase tools.

= 4.6.5 =

* Print pages load their styles and scripts with wp_register_style / wp_print_styles instead of inline tags.
* Works without the PHP mbstring extension.
* New: voting register for the general meeting.
* New: optional milestones (round birthdays and membership anniversaries) with configurable years; optional birth year or date for members; new custom field type Date.

* Prepared for the WordPress.org plugin directory: unique jasrek_ prefix (settings are migrated automatically), English readme, stricter escaping and prepared SQL queries.

= 4.6.1 =
